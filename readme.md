# Analysis of Structural Members with Slope Deflection Method using Rust

Ideally, the analysis of Structural Members using the slope deflection methods is done for the following reasons:

1. To determine the deflection of a member under a load.
2. To determine the reaction forces on a member.
3. To determine the shear forces on a member.
4. To determine the bending moment on a member.
5. To determine the deflection of a member under a shear force.
6. To determine the deflection of a member under a bending moment.
7. To determine the deflection of a member under a torsion.

And this is done on the following ideal structures: 

1. Continuous beam
2. Frames without side sways
3. Frames with side sways

STEPS TO CALCULATING SLOPE DEFLECTION METHOD:

1. Create a new project
2. Create a new structure
3. Create a new member
4. Create a new load
5. Create a new analysis
6. Run the analysis
 

This is a library for everything solving structural analysis using Rust.

To run the test
